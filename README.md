My Recipe App is an Android application built entirely with Kotlin and designed using Jetpack Compose for the UI. The app fetches recipe categories and detailed recipes from a free distributed API using Retrofit for network calls. In the Main activity, the app sets up a navigation controller with a custom theme and displays the recipe categories. Upon selecting a category, the app fetches and displays the detailed recipes within that category. The app is developed in Android Studio, ensuring a seamless and modern user experience with the latest Android development practices.
